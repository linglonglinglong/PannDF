With im2col implementation, we remove all-zero rows and columns and concatenate the remaining ones. Then we apply GEMM with off-the-shelf libraries. While unstructured pruning often produces unstructured and random connections which is hard to implement for speedup on general hardware platforms. Even with sparse matrix kernels, the speedup is very limited. \n\nGenerally, structured pruning focuses on acceleration and unstructured pruning focuses on compression. Pros and cons can depend on specific application scenarios. For an application caring more about low latency, structured pruning counts more; while for an application caring more about storage, unstructured pruning will be better.",

Seems like this work is very similar to \"Learning Structured Sparsity in Deep Neural Networks NIPS 2016\" in essence.\n\nI have a question about the results. What is the accuracy after pruning? For UCF101. How many (what is the percentage) of filters/shape/channels reduced after pruning?\n\nAnother question is, how do you compare the pros and cons for structured pruning and unstructured pruning (like deep compression by Song Han) for 3D NN?\n\nThanks!",

                "comment": "Thanks to the Reviewer for the valuable comments.\n\nWe believe the proposed method is very useful for the acceleration of 3D-CNN. TP and FP are two popular pruning methods closely related with our method. We believe that these two methods are more comparable to our method than other acceleration methods (such as Low-rank Decomposition and Knowledge Distillation). That’s the reason why we chose these two methods to compare. Admittedly, given the rapid development of this area, there are more recent pruning methods (such as [*1-*3]), but due to the limited time, we haven’t compared with them on 3D-CNN, which we leave for the future work. Thanks to the Reviewer for pointing this out.\n\nIn addition, since TP and FP didn’t experiment on C3D and 3D-ResNet18 in their papers, we have to implement their methods ourselves. TP and FP are quite straight to implement, so we believe our comparison is affirmatively valid.\n\n[*1] Liu, Zhuang, et al. \"Learning efficient convolutional networks through network slimming.\" Computer Vision (ICCV), 2017 IEEE International Conference on.

                "comment": "We thank Reviewer for the constructive comments. \n\n1. We refer to Wang’s article[9] to get the Eq.(2), the main reason for its setting is as follows:\n(1) This function must be decremented because we need to decrease the regularization parameter of the important groups.\n(2) This function needs to be equal to 0 when the average rank is $RN_g$, which ensures that at the end of pruning, there are exactly $RN_g$ weight groups to be pruned. Namely, if the average ranks less than $RN_g$, we need to increase their regularization parameters to further decrease their L1 norms; and those with greater L1 norms and rank above $RN_g$, we need to decrease regularization parameters to further increase their L1 norms. Since we decrease the L1 norms of weight groups whose ranks are less than $RN_g$ and increase the L1 norms of weight groups whose ranks are greater than $RN_g$, there should be $RN_g$ pruned weight groups at the convergence point.\n\n2. The reason for setting $A$ to $0.5*lambda$ is that we want to make a connection between $A$ and the weight decay. The weight decay is also an important hyper-parameter in regularization. This setting prevents us from blindly setting $A$ when experimenting with different models. $A$ should be on the same order of magnitude as the weight decay while the specific number 0.5 is not so important. However, $A$ can control the speed of convergence. Greater value of $A$ results in faster convergence.\n\n3. For a 2-D convolutional neural network with L layers, the weights of the lth convolutional layer W has the shape of N(l)*C(l)*W(l)*H(l). Here N(l), C(l), W(l) and H(l) are the dimensions along the axes of filter, channel, spatial width and spatial height. The feature map of l+1 layer has the shape of w(l)*h(l)*N(l). The computational cost will be W(l)*H(l)*C(l)*w(l)*h(l)*N(l).\n\nWhile for a 3-D convolutional neural network with L layers, the weights of the lth convolutional layer W has the shape of N(l)*C(l)*W(l)*H(l)*D(l). Here N(l), C(l), W(l), H(l) and D(l) are the dimensions along the axes of filter, channel, spatial width, spatial height and spatial depth. The feature map of l+1 layer has the shape of w(l)*h(l)*d(l)*N(l). The computational cost will be W(l)*H(l)*D(l)*C(l)*w(l)*h(l)*d(l)*N(l).\n \n4. We are sorry for the typo, the $\\omega^\\{g\\}$ should be $W^{(l)}_g$, which represents the different groups of weights. We have modified it in the latest uploaded article.\n"
